      There are long queues in front of the toll plazas and therefore E-lanes are being installed to save time and money. The method used by industries and advanced countries is the Electronic tag collection system. The said is also implemented on MotorwayS in India.

      Most Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) systems around the world are implemented by DSRC (Dedicated Short Range Communication) technology. In the case of fuel stations, the same thing happens on a daily basis, long queues are formed at highways and in cities for refueling, thus resulting in longer travel times. The concept proposed is to perform an automatic transaction of fuel dispensing at a fuel station, where the remaining balance will be updated and a text will be sent to the client using the blynk app. It is an innovative technology for fuel stations payment solutions. The project focuses mainly on the RFID technology based prepaid accounts associated with a RFID tag.

      We do not have to carry a fine amount of money with us which relates to safety as well. This system does not require any manual operation and collection of amounts. It is an entirely automated tag collection system. The proper information of vehicles along with vehicle owners are registered and their account is created, where they recharge their account with the required amount. When a client transacts through the RFID-tag system, the amount of transaction is deducted from the client's account and the remaining balance is updated as a new balance.
